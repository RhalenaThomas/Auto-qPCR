                                <p>Absolute quantification estimates the quantity of transcripts in unknown genes in the sample compared to a calibration curve of the total sample RNA in the sample. The data used will be the “quantiy (ng)” or cDNA.</p>

 <p>Upload your data: Nativage to your folder of raw data csv files. These should be the output files
                                from you PCR machine.
                                If you don't have a csv use excel to save a csv file.
                                You can included multiple spread sheets.  The data will
                                be combined into a single analysis. For separate analysis
                                you must separately upload and analyze the data. Be sure to
                                inclue the control genes you want to normalize. </p>    <!--text ins

                            genes you wish to normalize agains. Actin or GADPH are common options.
                            You must enter the gene names exactly as they appear in your data spread sheet.
                            You many enter multiple control genes.  Separate the genes with commas.
                            The average of the techinical replicates will be used to calculate expression values.

                            <p> Techical replicate for a given sample will be removed if the SD
                                of a given sample is above the threshold (default 0.3).
                               
Replicates will be removed until the SD is below the cuttoff.

                            <p> How many technical replicates can be removed to reach the standard deviation cut off about?
                                The default of 0.5 means that in 3  technical replicates only one can be removed. </p>
